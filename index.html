        <p>Dear Nayolit,</p>
        <p>I know I've said this many different times in different ways, but this time I put a lot of effort into actually putting my thoughts and feelings into words. I really donâ€™t just love you, itâ€™s so much more than that. I feel so connected to you, I couldnâ€™t even imagine you not being in my life at this point. When I wake up, I think about you. I think about what youâ€™re doing, how youâ€™re feeling, and I think about these things all day. The littlest things remind me of you. I really care so much about you.

I know right now you might not feel the same. Iâ€™m not entirely sure why, but I have some ideas. Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t feel the same, itâ€™s okay if youâ€™ve gotten bored. I really feel we were truly meant to be together. Whatever this is, I feel it has to be temporary, so I will always wait for you. Iâ€™m not even able to see another girl in the way I see you. Other girls donâ€™t even grab my attention at all. Youâ€™re the most perfect, kind, sweet, and beautiful girl Iâ€™ve ever met, and I feel so lucky to have met you. I donâ€™t even think that kind of luck is possible, there has to be a reason behind us meeting. There has to be a reason you stuck by me even when I was going through some bad things and wasnâ€™t able to talk to you. You welcomed me back after those things like nothing even happened, you were still there for me. I was so relieved by that. I was so scared it wouldnâ€™t have been that way, but the moment I got home, there you were, just waiting for me. There has to be some reason behind the strong bond and connection we had before. I know on my end itâ€™s still there. Maybe you just wandered down the wrong path? A long path, but I know that path has to lead back to the one Iâ€™m on eventually. Iâ€™m going to wait for you to get here. Iâ€™ll wait my entire life if thatâ€™s what it takes. Thereâ€™s no other girl that could ever compare to you, and I know I could never ever feel these feelings for another human being other than you.

My feelings for you are so strong, words arenâ€™t even enough to express them. I understand if you feel you might have to experiment with some other guys. After all, how else could you know I was the one if you had nothing to compare it to? I just want you to know, I will always love you so much. Youâ€™ll always have my entire heart, and when you feel you would like to return to me, Iâ€™ll be waiting to welcome you. Youâ€™re really home for me. I feel so at ease talking to you. You make everything feel okay, you make me feel so special, the luckiest guy ever to have you. You make me focus on the bigger picture rather than the struggles I face right now. I want so much to just have a life with you, a future with you, even children someday. My dream future is anything with you in it. Thatâ€™s what I want for my life, to be with you, to experience this connection of ours on a deeper level every day.

I just want you to know, Iâ€™m not upset that you might want to try out other flowers. You canâ€™t know for sure the flower you had was the best for you until youâ€™ve had others. I understand if youâ€™re not ready to water a flower every day. Itâ€™s a huge commitment, and you have your own life going on right now, your own struggles. I try my best to help you through those things, but even Iâ€™m not sure how to go about my own struggles. This flower will always be waiting for you, waiting until youâ€™re ready, waiting until you have enough water. I know I love my flower deeply, unconditionally. No matter what my flower ever did or will do, I will always love it. I would always appreciate its beauty. Iâ€™ll always take care of my flower in any way I can. My flower is really special to me, thereâ€™s no other flower like it. I hope eventually I can be given this flower again. I promise I would cherish it till the end.

I love you. </p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,<br>Ben.</p>
